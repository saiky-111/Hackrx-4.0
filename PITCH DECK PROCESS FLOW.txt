        -User initiates a conversation with the Chatbot by asking a medical query or expressing a health concern.
        -The Chatbot welcomes the user and prompts them to provide more details about their query.

    2. Information gathering and query analysis:
        -The Chatbot collects relevant information from the user, such as symptoms, medical history, or specific concerns.
        -It analyzes the user's query to understand the context and determine the appropriate response.

    3. Knowledgebase integration:
        -The Chatbot platform seamlessly integrates with reputed knowledgebase sources, such as the Mayo Clinic website and WebMD, as well as authenticated databases.
        -The Chatbot retrieves relevant information from these sources based on the user's query and context.

    4. Response generation:
        -Using the retrieved information, the Chatbot generates accurate and relevant responses to address the user's query.
        -It ensures that the responses are trustworthy, as they originate from reputable sources like Mayo Clinic and WebMD.

    5. Corona self-checker module:
        -If the user's query or symptoms indicate a potential risk related to COVID-19, the Chatbot can provide a link or prompt the user to access the corona self-checker module.
        -The self-checker module guides the user through a series of questions to assess their risk level and provides recommendations based on their responses.

    6. Corona test booking module:
        -If the user's risk level indicates the need for a COVID-19 test, the Chatbot can offer the option to book a test.
        -It can provide information about testing centers, availability, and booking procedures.
        -The Chatbot may integrate with a test booking module to facilitate the process of scheduling appointments for the user.

    7. Configurable options:
        -The Chatbot platform should provide configurable options that allow users to enable or disable specific knowledgebase sources based on their preferences.
        -Users can customize the Chatbot's behavior by choosing the sources they trust or prefer to obtain information from.

    8. User feedback and continuous improvement:
        -The Chatbot platform includes a mechanism to collect user feedback.
        -Users can provide feedback on the accuracy and relevance of the responses, usability of the interface, and overall experience.

        -The UI should be intuitive, visually appealing, and guide users through the conversation smoothly.

    10. Backend data pipeline:
        -The Chatbot's backend data pipeline is optimized to efficiently handle data retrieval, processing, and delivery of responses.
        -It ensures fast and accurate retrieval of information from the integrated knowledgebase sources and authenticated databases.

    11. Scalability and cost considerations:
        -The Chatbot platform is designed to be scalable to accommodate a large number of end users.
        -Cost-effectiveness is taken into account when considering the infrastructure and maintenance requirements for serving a large user base.
